My College Projects

	Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you'll find a collection of projects I completed during my college journey, showcasing my skills in various programming languages and technologies. The repository includes several C++ applications, Java programs, and a series of shell scripts (SH files) that demonstrate my proficiency with Unix commands for managing tasks on a UNIX server. Additionally, I've included a few assembly projects that highlight my understanding of low-level programming. Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate!
